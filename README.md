This is a "TronG" game. It is freely inspired by the movie "Tron".
I made this game as an exam in pygame while studying programming in the "ZA RĄCZKĘ" mentoring program. That mentoring program was created by Daniel Roziecki and the exam finish the first path of it (basic path).

After starting the game, you can use the options menu where you can select the difficulty of the game. You can choose the disk speed, computer speed (in the version when the computer is an opponent) and the maximum level of points to end the game.

The attraction of the game is that the disc accelerates after each bounce by paddle. Acceleration can be stopped by gluing the disc to the paddle by pressing the ALT key (left ALT for the left player or right ALT for the right player).
After each point lost, disk acceleration stops.

The disk is stuck to the paddle as long as the ALT key is pressed.

The second attraction of the game is that the disc can be bounced in the direction the paddle is going. For example, as the disc moves upward, you can bounce it upward as the paddle rises, or bounce the disc downward by moving the paddle downward.

In the game I use:
 - sounds from https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/
- fonts written by Jeff Bell (www.randombell.com)
- Python sprite sheet script from https://github.com/russs123/pygame_tutorials/blob/main/sprite_tutorial/spritesheet.py

Have a fun
